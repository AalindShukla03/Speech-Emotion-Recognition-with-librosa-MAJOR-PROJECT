# Speech Emotion Recognition with Librosa - Major Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a system for recognizing and classifying human emotions based on speech signals. The system takes audio input, processes the speech signals using the Librosa library, and predicts the corresponding emotional state. Emotions include categories such as neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and surprised.

## Key Features

- **Audio Data Collection:** Utilizes a dataset containing audio recordings of human speech with labeled emotional states.
  
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts features from audio signals, including Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma, mel, contrast, and tonnetz.

- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements a neural network model using Keras with a TensorFlow backend for learning patterns from the extracted features and predicting emotions.

- **Flask Web Application:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for users to upload audio files and receive predictions about the emotional content.

## Project Structure

- `audio_data/`: Directory containing the audio dataset.
  
- `model/`: Directory for storing the trained machine learning model.

- `static/`: Static files for the Flask web application.

- `templates/`: HTML templates for the Flask web application.

- `utils.py`: Python script containing utility functions for feature extraction and prediction.

- `train_model.py`: Script for training the machine learning model.

- `app.py`: Main script for the Flask web application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AalindShukla03/Speech-Emotion-Recognition-with-librosa-MAJOR-PROJECT-.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Extract the features for Model (Optional):
   ```bash
   python speech_extract.py
   ```

   
4. Train the Speech Model (Optional):

   ```bash
   python speech_train.py
   ```

5. Run the Flask web application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Librosa
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Flask
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Future Scope

- **Real-Time Processing:** Extend the system to process and classify emotions in real-time.
  
- **Additional Features:** Enhance the system with sentiment analysis or speaker identification for a more comprehensive analysis.

- **User Interface Enhancements:** Improve the web application's user interface and add features for a better user experience.

- **Multi-modal Emotion Recognition:** Expand the system to recognize emotions from multi-modal data sources, such as combining speech and facial expressions.

## Acknowledgments

- The project uses the Librosa library for audio feature extraction.
